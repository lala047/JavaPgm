If string is coming first and then + sysmnbol is there - next part automatically convert into String

What is class 

class is a combination of Method , Objects and Constructor

 

if anything is missing we cant execute our pgm

constructor name and class name should be same


Object ?

Replica of class or we can say blue print of class


WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver() //RunTime polymorphims (Method Overiding)

Inheritance :- Acquiring the properties from other class - that is called a inheritance 

we can achieve with the help of extends keyword in java


what is multilevel Inheritance ?

Step by Step Inheritance or we can say generation by generation Transformation - called a Multilevel Inheritance


Multiple Inheritance

One class want to inherit more than one class at a Time - Multiple Inheritance 

can we achieve multiple Inheritance in java ?
No , we cant achieve at class level but we can achieve at Interface level 


What is the major difference between Multiple And Multilevel 


Single Inheritance -  Simple Inheritance extends Keyword

Many To One Inheritance ?


One To Many - Multiple Inheritance - We can achieve at Interface Level


Method Over riding ?

Same Methods and Same Signature/Parameter with different implementation and we can achieve with the help of Inheritance


Assignment :- You have create a program for MNC Company where logo should be same but salary of employee will override according to reason


Method Over loading - We will use same class , using Same Methods but different signature/Parameter/Data Type - no inheritance 


int -- Whole number  --- medium range
long -- whole number---  High Range
short -- whole number------ Less than integer and higher than byte -- assignment
byte -- whole number------- very less range -- assignment

double-- decimal --- High Range
float-- decimal----- Low range

boolean-- true/false
char---- 'a' ,'b'

String :- String is not a Data type - it is a class - why  we will discuss in String topic

but we will use like a data type - but it is not a data type


Constructor :- 

Constructor name and class name should be same 

if user is not creating a constructor - jvm will create default or blank constructor

if user is creating any constructor - jvm never create blank or default constructor

constructor doesnt have any return type like void


Polymorphism:- Multiple 

same object behaving different different instance through out the execution of the pgm that is called a Polymorphism

we have a two type of polymorphism

run time polymorphism -- Method Over riding , Inheritance and Upcasting - all three thing is mandatory to achieve run time poly

Upcasting means - trying to create a object of parent class and call child constructor - that is called a Upcasting

compile time polymorphism - Method Over loading

Abstraction:-

abstract is a keyword which we will use in class and methods

if class is abstract - so we can declare abstract method and non abstract method as well

abstract Method - Unimplemented method or we can no body or no implementation of that methods

non abstract method - - It just like a method which we created before

Abstract class is not a complete class - that why we cant create object of abstract class

abstract class - we cant achieve 100% abstraction - why because they are containing non abstract method 


Interface - Only Abstract Method

Interface - we have to use abstract method only 

no need to use abstract keyword inside into the interface - because by default it is abstract 

they are not containing any body - all are unimplemented Method 

class will implements interface - we have to use implements keyword to implement any interface

class- class - Extends
Interface - Interface - extends

class - interface - implements

Nested Concept

class - class  - True
Interface - Interface- true
Class- Interface--- true
Interface - Class -true


- if method is static no need to create Object - we can call method with the help of Classname.MethodName 

static can be a Method
Static can be a Variable
Static can be a nested class -

static can be a Block 



stack     heap                       ClassMamory
 
color    heap                         static color=heap

s        StaticVariableandmethod



String is mutable or immutable and why?



Exception Handling :- 


final can be a method -- we cant override
final can be class ---- we cant inherited
final can be a variable -- we cant reinitialized




Private protected default and public


Super can be a Method
Super can be a Variable
super can be a constructor 

Super- Calling Parent class, we will use super with the help of extends keyword (ref: super concept(package), SuperVariableMethod(class)
// Add super to the method or variable of the child class(this child class already extends the parent) to access the parent class



This - Current


this will use for variable method and constructor
